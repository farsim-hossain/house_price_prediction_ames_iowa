This project explores the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to predict real estate prices using a comprehensive dataset. The dataset includes 81 variables detailing various attributes of properties, such as building class, zoning classification, lot size, utility types, neighborhood characteristics, and overall quality and condition of the buildings. By employing machine learning and advanced neural network architectures, we aim to create a predictive model that accurately forecasts the sale price of properties. The model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, and the results will be analyzed to understand the influence of different features on property prices.

## Objective

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Explore and engineer features to enhance the model's predictive power.
Model Development: Design and implement various deep learning architectures to find the most effective model for price prediction.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Feature Analysis: Investigate the impact of different features on the prediction outcomes to gain insights into the key drivers of property prices.
Optimization and Tuning: Optimize the model through hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best possible performance.
Deployment: Create a deployment strategy for the model to be used in real-world applications, providing valuable predictions for stakeholders.
